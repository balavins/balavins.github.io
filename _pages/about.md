## Welcome to my personal page. 

I probably won't update this often, but I wanted to try to put together all of my publicly available work here, so its all in one place. I also want to create a blog with papers that I read or tools that I frequently use, but babysteps üôÇ


## My Background 
I am currently the Co-founder(2015-present) and V.P of Core Engineering(2020-present) at Bigstream. Prior to that I was a PhD candidate at UT-Austin(Dropped out with M.S after Bigstream). I started my career at Broadcom Research in India. I have pretty good experience in managing people, writing C/C++/Scala code, architecting FPGA and System designs.
Currently focusing on big-data acceleration using heterogenous devices. Outside of work, I am a decent tennis and table-tennis player.

## Areas of Interest:   

  * Heterogenous Computing.
  * Internals of Big Data Analytics Frameworks.    
  * Databases.         
  * Security & Computer Architecture.   

## Talks

These come to my mind immediately.    
ADMS 2019 Talk: Computational Storage For Big Data Analytics  [paper](http://www.adms-conf.org/2019-camera-ready/bala_adms19.pdf),  [slides](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c00b/08fea9622d147574e69ec39a3ebf102f332d.pdf)     
Intel HPC Developer Conference Talk-2017: Hyperacceleration of Apache Spark with Intel Arria 10 FPGAs [Slides](https://github.com/balavins/balavins.github.io/blob/master/assets/pdfs/Intel_HPC_Outline_v2.6.pdf).    
Xilinx Developer Forum (XDF) 2019.      

## My Management Principles
I am a huge fan of Ray Dalio's [Principles](https://www.principles.com/). In my current role, I try to be radically transparent and open to the extent possible. Following are some of my favorites from the list

```
* Make believablity-weighted decisions
* Pain + Reflection = Progress
* Own your outcomes
* Be Radically Open-minded
* Get and Stay in Sync
```
One of my favorite quotes from Dalio is the following

```
In every relationship, try to be on the far side of fair
```

Apart from Ray Dalio, [The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897). It has good examples and scenaios that are prevalent in the industry. 

Somethings that I have learnt are as follows:   
One of the things I firmly believe in when managing is that people are inherently smart, all any kind of manager needs to provide is a concret goal and structure to make that goal attainable. Most people can make strategic and sound decisions on what needs to be done.
I cannot emphasize enough, how important it is to be in sync in startups. When things are fast moving, it is ever important to make sure everyone knows why they are doing something.
