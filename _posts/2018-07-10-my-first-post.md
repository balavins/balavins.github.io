This is my first post.
My plan is to have references and papers that I find interesting and organize them by title
I had a lot of code-snippets, tools that I found interesting, etc lying around in google keep or else-where. 
Plan to port them here for completeness after making them readable

A source of inspiration for me to start the blogs has been [The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/about/)
